### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Go to your service ‚Üí Variables tab

#### Generate JWT Secret
Run locally:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy output and add to Railway:
```
JWT_SECRET=<paste-generated-secret>
```

#### Get DeepSeek API Key
1. Visit https://platform.deepseek.com
2. Sign up / Sign in
3. Go to API Keys
4. Create new key
5. Copy and add to Railway:
```
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=<paste-api-key>
```

#### Set Environment
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 5. Verify Variables
Check that you have:
- [x] JWT_SECRET (you set)
- [x] DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (you set)
- [x] NODE_ENV (you set)
- [x] MONGODB_URI (auto-set by Railway)
- [x] PORT (auto-set by Railway)

### 6. Trigger Redeploy
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Deploy" or push a new commit
3. Watch build logs
4. Wait for "Deployment successful"

### 7. Generate Domain
