# Development Progress - Phase 2

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Real-time Config Updates (Completed)
**Problem**: Changes in Appearance page didn't reflect immediately in Live Preview.

**Solution**:
- Added `useEffect` in `ChatWidgetContext` to watch for `initialConfig` changes
- Config now updates instantly when user changes settings
- Live Preview shows real-time updates

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/ChatWidgetContext.tsx` - Added useEffect for config sync

### 2. Config Persistence (Completed)
**Problem**: Widget settings were lost on page refresh.

**Solution**:
- Created `usePersistedConfig` custom hook
- Saves config to localStorage automatically
- Loads saved config on mount
- Added "Reset to Defaults" button

**Files Created**:
- `src/hooks/usePersistedConfig.ts` - Custom hook for localStorage persistence

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/app/Appearance.tsx` - Uses usePersistedConfig, added Reset button

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-save to localStorage on every change
- ‚úÖ Auto-load from localStorage on mount
- ‚úÖ Reset button to restore defaults
- ‚úÖ Toast notification on reset
- ‚úÖ Error handling for localStorage failures

### 3. TypeScript Improvements (Completed)
**Problem**: Using `any` types in components.

**Solution**:
- Exported `WidgetConfig` type from ChatWidgetContext
- Updated AppearanceControls to use proper types
- Updated LivePreview to use proper types

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/appearance/AppearanceControls.tsx`
- `src/components/appearance/LivePreview.tsx`

## üîß Technical Debt

### Known Issues
1. **Label Component Errors**: Shadcn/ui Label component has type issues
   - Impact: Low (doesn't affect functionality)
   - Solution: Update shadcn/ui or fix Label types

2. **Fast Refresh Warnings**: Context exports trigger warnings
   - Impact: None (development only)
   - Solution: Separate hooks into different files
   - Priority: Low

### Performance Optimizations Needed
- [ ] Memoize expensive computations in ChatModal
- [ ] Virtualize long message lists
- [ ] Lazy load conversation history
- [ ] Optimize re-renders in LivePreview

### Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- [ ] Improve keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add screen reader announcements
- [ ] Test with accessibility tools

## üìù Notes

### Config Persistence Details
- Storage Key: `mintchat_widget_config`
- Stored as JSON string
- Merges with defaults on load
- Handles localStorage errors gracefully

### Real-time Updates
- Uses React useEffect with dependency on initialConfig
- Updates config state when prop changes
- Preserves user's conversation state during updates

### Next Development Session
**Focus**: Complete Widget UX improvements
- Loading states
- Error handling
